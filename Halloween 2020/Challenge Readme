Spooky Halloween to everyone !

The challenge is to make a small Halloween Scene or objects to celebrate these spooky times ! 
So from a simple pumpkin to a mini game or animated scene, anything really, just make something.
We also accept prototypes since it's kinda the same idea. 

Constructive feedback is welcome, let's remain civilised :D 

The event ends on 31st October 2020 !
Enjoy !
