Autumn Challenge !

This challenge consists in creating an animated background based on our though and vision of what "autumn" represents.

My vision of an animated background would be : 
  Landscape : Foreground is composed of a simple cosy grass place and a tree, then some wheat farms and stuff far away, very background is a mountain.
  Animations : Falling leaves, sun and clouds (with sunrays), birds
  Extra ideas : A key could change the weather ? Or the time (night / day) ? (We will see if I have time to do it since I BEGIN 22 days late lmao)
  Good luck cuz I wont put comments on that code.

void setup(){
  size(1100,600);
  background(50);

void draw(){
